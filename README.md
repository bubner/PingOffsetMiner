# PingOffsetMiner
### Forge 1.8.9 Hypixel Skyblock
A mod that takes into account ping offset when mining ores in Hypixel Skyblock, allowing for faster mining.  
This mod displays a visualiser on the screen when they can safely move to the next ore, as the server has already registered the block as broken.
